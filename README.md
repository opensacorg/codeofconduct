# Open Sacramento's Code of Conduct

**Open Sacramento fosters a community that:**

1. Is a safe and respectful environment for all participants.
2. Allows for the free expression of all identities.
3. Welcomes everyone's ideas, skills, and contributions.
4. Actively invites curiosity instead of assumptions.
5. Encourages people to find and utilize their strengths and skills productively. We can foster this environment through "yes/and" statements.
6. Invites members and leaders to practice active listening to better understand new perspectives.
7. Strives to build open source tools for public use. Private gain is not the priority.
8. Sees the strength in diverse teams and seeks input from those who's voices have been excluded.
9. Works to bring in people who are not recognized as "main stream" for any reason including race, gender, economic status, etc. They shall be included throughout the planning, designing, and implementation phases of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups. 
10. Seeks out people with subject matter expertise in the decision making processes.
11. Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.

**Open Sacramento reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Open Sacramento network activities, events, and digital forums.**

# Open Sacramento's Anti-Harassment Policy

This anti-harassment policy is based on [the example policy](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

This policy is based on several other policies, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups contributed to this work.

### Open Sacramento fosters a community that:

In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Open Sacramento will only lend its brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an anti-harassment policy to your group, see this guide.

Open Sacramento is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Open Sacramento event or network activity, including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Open Sacramento network activities, events, and digital forums, at the discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Open Sacramento network activities, events, and digital forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/JF3Q1AQA6pGxNSNS8).

We are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and can provide an environment that is welcoming to all.

**We value your attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.**
